# GoodMusic

**GoodMusic** is a modern, offline-first music player for ios designed to bring the best experience to your local audio collection. It combines a clean, intuitive interface with powerful organization tools, ensuring your music is always played your way.

## Key Features

### **Contextual Playback**
Navigate seamlessly through your library. Whether you're exploring an artist's discography, diving into an album, or shuffling a playlist, GoodMusic keeps your context intact. The player creates a "logical queue" based on where you started, so you can easily return to that specific list or search result.

### **Flexible "Lens" Favorite System**
Most music players treat "Favorites" as just another static playlist. GoodMusic takes a different approach.

**How it works:** Think of your favorites as a "lens" you can apply to any view. 
*   **Generic Players:** You have to leave your current album or artist view to go find your "Favorites" playlist.
*   **GoodMusic:** You can toggle the "Favorites Only" mode *anywhere*.
    *   Browsing an Artist? Toggle it to see **only your favorite songs by that artist**.
    *   Viewing an Album? Toggle it to highlight the best tracks.
    *   Searching? Filter your results instantly.
This allows you to rediscover your best-loved tracks within their original context, rather than isolating them in a separate list.

### **Synced Lyrics**
Sing along with precision. GoodMusic supports `.lrc` files to display real-time, synced lyrics that highlight as the song plays. Tap any line to instantly seek to that part of the audio.

### **Smart Library Management**
*   **Categorized Browsing:** Effortlessly switch between Songs, Artists, Albums, and Playlists.
*   **Global Search:** Find what you're looking for instantly, with results grouped clearly by category.
*   **Playlist Control:** Create and manage custom playlists with ease.
